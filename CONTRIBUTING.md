First of all, I would like to thank anyone that decides to contribute.
There is one thing that I would like to ask from you though.
If you decide to add a new city, there are a few guidelines that I would like you to follow.

1. Please don't add a city if it's population is under 100, 000. The reason for this is because there will most likely not be
anyone searching for that city. I will however make exceptions to this if the city is a popular tourist destination, it's a
country's capital or there's a really important historical event that took place there.

2. Please put the city's bubble near the bubbles of other cities that are in the same time zone. For example, let's say you 
wanted to add Brussels. You should put it beside Paris since they are in the same time zone.

3. !IMPORTANT! 
This is the most important one out of them all. 
Give appropriate credit for the images used. Underneath all the bubbles, there is a image legality section and here is all the
information that is required for the images. Here u must identify the image that you put, for example: 'Halifax Image:',
and make sure to put it in the same order as it is for the bubbles, so let's say you put it in between the New York City and 
the Rio de Janeiro bubbles, then put it in between the information for the New York City and Rio de Janeiro images. Also, make
sure to put all the information that you are obligated to put by that image's licence/copyright/disclaimer.

Any cities that have already been added before I made this file and don't respect either or both of the first 2 rules, 
will be grandfathered in. But if it doesn't respect the 3rd rule, then it needs to be fixed, since then it could become a
potential copyright or even legal issue in extreme cases.
